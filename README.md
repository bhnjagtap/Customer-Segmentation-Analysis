# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a customer segmentation model using K-Means clustering. By analyzing purchasing behavior and demographic data, the model identifies distinct customer groups, providing actionable insights for businesses to tailor their marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.
- **Clustering**: Implemented K-Means clustering to segment customers.
- **Visualization**: Generated detailed plots and graphs to visualize the clusters.
- **Insights**: Provided actionable insights to improve business strategies.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: The core programming language used.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and visualization.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning algorithms and tools.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Data visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the from Kaggle, which contains information on customer demographics and purchasing behavior.

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Open Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. **Run the notebook**:
    - Open `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
    - Execute the cells to preprocess data, run clustering, and visualize the results.

## Results

The project segments customers into distinct groups based on their annual income and spending score. The visualizations highlight the clusters, providing insights into customer behavior that can help businesses optimize their marketing strategies.
